# snake_game_by_face_detection_model
Model predict 4 classess based on CNN


***IMPORTANT***



*This repo just have trainning file, sample model file, and cv2 source code
*If you want to try, please use Colab GPU to training a model following those below instruction


*First, using `data_generator/data_generate.py` to save dataset for training and validation
*Run this file 4 times and in each time, change the `data/<need to change this>` to `data/left`, `data/right`, etc.

 Secondly, using those capture file and copy and divide to `colab_data` as example
 Update all `colab_data` folder to Google Colab or copy this. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wSZPNAQHI9OUtFgZiw-5Vk5U3ewq1DFy?authuser=1#scrollTo=FbqnPEwN1jyI)
 Using GPU and using suit params.
 
 ==========
 Download and using your trained model by `main.py` file.
